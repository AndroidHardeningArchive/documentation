            <h1>Releases</h1>
            <p>These releases are available as both tags in the source code repositories and
            official builds.</p>
            <p>The factory images are used for the initial installation and can be verified with
            GPG. See the <a href="/install">installation guide</a> for details.</p>
            <p>GrapheneOS uses automatic over-the-air updates, but full update packages are listed
            below for uncommon use cases like never connecting the device to the internet. A full
            update package can upgrade from any past version to the new version. The over-the-air
            updates use delta update packages when available. Those aren't currently linked below
            but may be in the future once they're being used more consistently. Update packages
            are not for performing the initial installation and you should ignore incorrect guides
            trying to use them to install the OS.</p>
            <p>Releases are tested by the developers and are then pushed out via the Beta channel.
            The release is then pushed out via the Stable channel after being tested by some users
            using the Beta channel. In some cases, problems are caught during Beta channel testing
            and a new release is made via the Beta channel to replace the aborted one. In general,
            it's not possible to downgrade unless a downgrade update package is generated, so use
            the Stable channel if you cannot tolerate dealing with temporary issues while a new
            release for the Beta channel is being created.</p>
