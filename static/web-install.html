            <h1><a href="#web-install">Web install</a></h1>

            <p>This is the beginning of a WebUSB-based installer for GrapheneOS. Very little has
            been implemented and it doesn't do anything useful yet. You should ignore this page
            and use the <a href="/install">official install guide</a>.</p>

            <section id="prerequisites">
                <h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

                <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 8GB of free storage
                space.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever
                possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the
                device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality
                USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on
                a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports
                on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the
                most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the
                officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS. You should make sure
                your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding with these instructions. Older
                versions and other Linux distributions usually work, but if you encounter problems try
                using one of the officially supported options.</p>

                <p>For this web-based installation process, the latest stable release of Chromium
                or Chrome is recommended.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
                be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
                variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
                flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
                carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
                bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
                support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
                device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
                carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id
                and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running
                the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running
                into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. You can
                either update the device via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for
                Pixel phones can be obtained from the
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">full update package page</a>.</p>

            <section id="enabling-oem-unlocking">
                <h2><a href="#enabling-oem-unlocking">Enabling OEM unlocking</a></h2>

                <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>

                <p>Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ➔ About phone and
                pressing on the build number menu entry until developer mode is enabled.</p>

                <p>Next, go to Settings ➔ System ➔ Advanced ➔ Developer options and toggle on the
                'Enable OEM unlocking' setting. This requires internet access on devices with Google
                Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for anti-theft protection.</p>

            <section id="connecting-phone">
                <h2><a href="#connecting-phone">Connecting the phone</a></h2>

                <p>Connect the phone to the computer. On Linux, you'll need to do this again if
                you didn't have the udev rules set up when you connected it.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="unlocking-the-bootloader">
                <h2><a href="#unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</a></h2>

                <p>First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the
                device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.
                Alternatively, use ADB to reboot to the bootloader with the button below:</p>

                <button id="adb-reboot-bootloader" disabled="disabled">Reboot to bootloader with ADB</button>

                <p>Unlock the bootloader to allow flashing the OS and firmware:</p>

                <button id="unlock-bootloader" disabled="disabled">Unlock bootloader</button>

                <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device and will wipe all data. Use one
                of the volume keys to switch the selection to accepting it and the power button to
                confirm.</p>
