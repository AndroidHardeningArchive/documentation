            </h1>

            <p><strong>This is a newly created page (started 2020-12-05) and is in the process of
            being written. More details and links to more detailed documentation and relevant
            repositories will be added over time.</strong></p>

            <p>This is an overview of the current set of features differentiating GrapheneOS from
            the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). This page does not currently cover any of our
            historical features that are either not yet reimplemented or which became obsolete due
            to improvements in AOSP. Each major release of AOSP brings substantial privacy and
            security improvements, some of which have been based on our research and development
            work.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is based on the Android 11 release of the Android Open Source Project
            which provides a strong baseline for privacy and security. GrapheneOS takes great care
            to preserve the baseline privacy and security, including taking full advantage of all
            of the standard hardware features. The privacy and security features inherited from
            AOSP and the hardware are not covered here. Documentation on that will be gradually
            added elsewhere on our site.</p>

            <p>Partial list of GrapheneOS features beyond what AOSP 11 provides:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hardened app runtime</li>
                <li>Stronger app sandbox</li>
                <li>Hardened libc providing defenses against the most common classes of vulnerabilities (memory
  corruption)</li>
                <li>Our own <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md">hardened malloc (memory allocator)</a>
                leveraging modern hardware capabilities to provide substantial defenses against
                the most common classes of vulnerabilities (heap memory corruption) along with
                reducing the lifetime of sensitive data in memory</li>
                <li>Hardened kernel</li>
                <li>Prevention of dynamic native code execution in-memory or via the filesystem
                for the base OS without going via the package manager, etc.</li>
                <li>Filesystem access hardening</li>
                <li>Enhanced verified boot with better security properties and reduced attack surface</li>
                <li>Enhanced hardware-based attestation with more precise version information</li>
                <li>Eliminates remaining holes for apps to access hardware-based identifiers</li>
                <li>Greatly reduced remote, local and proximity-based attack surface by stripping out unnecessary
  code, making more features optional and disabling optional features by default or when the
  screen is locked</li>
                <li>Low-level improvements to the filesystem-based full disk encryption used on
                modern Android</li>
                <li>Support for logging out of user profiles without needing a device manager: makes them inactive so that they can't continue running code while using another profile, purges disk encryption keys (which are per-profile) from memory and hardware registers</li>
                <li>LTE-only mode to reduce cellular radio attack surface by disabling enormous amounts of legacy
  code</li>
                <li>Default enabled per-connection MAC randomization as an improvement over Android's default
  per-network MAC randomization reusing the same MAC address until the DHCP lease with that
  network expires</li>
                <li>Vanadium: hardened WebView and default browser</li>
                <li>Auditor: hardware-based attestation used to secure devices for users and
  organizations instead of using it as a form of DRM</li>
                <li>PDF Viewer: sandboxed, hardened PDF viewer using HiDPI rendering with pinch to zoom, text
  selection, etc.</li>
                <li>Secure application spawning system avoiding sharing address space layout and
                other secrets across applications</li>
                <li>Network permission toggle disallowing both direct and indirect network access, superior to a purely firewall-based implementation only disallowing direct access to the network without covering inter-process communication</li>
                <li>Sensors permission toggle</li>
                <li>Authenticated encryption for network time updates via a first party server to
                prevent attackers from changing the time and enabling attacks based on bypassing
                certificate / key expiry, etc.</li>
                <li>Proper support for disabling network time updates rather than just not using
                the results</li>
                <li>Connectivity checks via a first party server with the option to revert to the
                standard checks</li>
                <li>Hardened local build / signing infrastructure</li>
                <li>Seamless automatic OS update system that just works and stays out of the way
                    in the background without disrupting device usage</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Infrastructure features:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Strict privacy and security practices for our infrastructure</li>
                <li>Services hosted on OVH without involving any additional parties for CDNs,
                mirrors or other services - we don't outsource to others</li>
                <li>Our services are built with open technology stacks to avoid being locked in to
                any particular hosting provider or vendor</li>
                <li>Open documentation on our infrastructure including listing out all of our
                services, guides on making similar setups, published configurations for each
                of our web services, etc.</li>
                <li>No proprietary services</li>
                <li>Authenticated encryption for all of our services</li>
                <li>Strong cipher configurations for all of our services (SSH, TLS, etc.)</li>
                <li>DNSSEC for all our domains</li>
                <li>SSHFP across all domains for pinning SSH keys</li>
                <li>DANE TLSA records for pinning keys for all our TLS services (unfortunately only
                used by a subset of other mail services in practice, and not yet web
                browsers)</li>
                <li>Static key pinning for our services in apps like Auditor</li>
                <li>No cookies or similar client-side state for anything other than login sessions,
                which are set up via SameSite=strict cookies and have server-side session tracking
                with the ability to log out of other sessions</li>
                <li>scrypt-based password hashing (likely Argon2 when the available implementations
                are more mature)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Beyond the technical features of the OS:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Collaborative, open source project with a very active community and contributors</li>
                <li>Can make your own builds and make desired changes, so you aren't stuck with
                the decisions made by the upstream project</li>
                <li>Non-profit project avoiding conflicts of interest by keeping commercialization
                at a distance. Companies support the project rather than the project serving the
                needs of any particular company</li>
                <li>Strong privacy policies</li>
            </ul>
