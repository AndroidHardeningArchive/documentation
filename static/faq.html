            </h2>

            <p>GrapheneOS has official production support for the Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3,
            Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. The release tags for these devices have official
            builds and updates available. These devices meet the stringent privacy and security
            standards and have substantial upstream and downstream hardening specific to the
            devices.</p>

            <p>Many other devices are supported by GrapheneOS at a source level, and it can be
            built for them without modifications to the existing GrapheneOS source tree. Device
            support repositories for the Android Open Source Project can simply be dropped into
            the source tree, with at most minor modifications within them to support GrapheneOS.
            In most cases, substantial work beyond that will be needed to bring the support up to
            the same standards. For most devices, the hardware and firmware will prevent providing
            a reasonably secure device, regardless of the work put into device support.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS also supports generic targets, but these aren't suitable for production
            usage and are only intended for development and testing use. For mobile devices, the
            generic targets simply run on top of the underlying device support code (firmware,
            kernel, device trees, vendor code) rather than shipping it and keeping it updated. It
            would be possible to ship generic system images with separate updates for the device
            support code. However, it would be drastically more complicated to maintain and
            support due to combinations of different versions and it would cause complications for
            the hardening done by GrapheneOS. The motivation doesn't exist for GrapheneOS, since
            full updates with deltas to minimize bandwidth can be shipped for every device and
            GrapheneOS is the only party involved in providing the updates. For the same reason,
            it has little use for the ability to provide out-of-band updates to system image
            components including all the apps and many other components.</p>
