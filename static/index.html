            <p><em>This page is a placeholder for this newly created site and will soon be replaced

            beyond being a hardened fork of the Android Open Source Project into an OS without the
            Linux kernel at the core. There will also be proper documentation on building,
            installing and using the OS. There will also be coverage of relevant hardware,
            firmware and software security topics.</em></p>
            <p><em>Please bear in mind that this is only a preview of the project. It will become

            for their privacy and security properties including the availability of full security
            updates (including for firmware), competitive hardware / firmware security and all of
            the hardware-based security features (verified boot, attestation, exploit mitigations
            and a lot more) being made available to alternative operating systems like Pixels.</em></p>
            <h1>GrapheneOS</h1>
            <p>GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android
            app compatibility. Many past features of the project still need to be ported to the
            current releases. The project is in the 5th year of development and has been reborn as
            a non-profit open source project not strongly associated with any specific company or
            organization. It will take some time for the pieces to come into place turning it into
            a much broader and more sustainable project with a strong development team. There are
            multiple organizations and companies in the process of backing this new incarnation of
            the hardened mobile OS project. Official Releases are available on the
            <a href="/releases">releases page</a> and installation instructions are on the
            <a href="/install">install page</a>.</p>
            <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS">GitHub organization</a> for sources
            of the OS sub-projects including the cutting edge
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md">new
            hardened memory allocator</a>.</p>
            <p>The official GrapheneOS releases are supported by the
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases">Auditor app</a> and
            <a href="https://attestation.app/">attestation service</a> for hardware-based
            attestation. For more details, see the <a
            href="https://attestation.app/about">about page</a> and <a
            href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">tutorial</a>. You can also extend these with
            support for your own builds.</p>
            <p>The sources are available via the
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest">manifest on GitHub</a>.</p>
